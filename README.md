### Using object detection to enhance image search

An image search engine was developed, augmented by the YOLOR object detection algorithm. The data was indexed using BM25, and the interface was deployed through Streamlit. High precision was achieved in specific categories by the search engine, but misclassifications were found in YOLOR annotations, suggesting that more comprehensive training across various object classes was needed.

### Model evaluation for text search 

Information retrieval was examined using the Vector Space Model, Best Matching 25 (BM25), and ELECTRA on the renowned Cranfield collection. The data underwent preprocessing, which involved normalizing texts and removing stop words. Among the models, BM25 performed best with a Mean Average Precision of 0.3137. After fine-tuning, this model was deployed in a Streamlit interface.
