### Using object detection to enhance image search

An image search engine was developed, augmented by the YOLOR object detection algorithm. The data was indexed using BM25, and the interface was deployed through Streamlit. High precision was achieved in specific categories by the search engine, but misclassifications were found in YOLOR annotations, suggesting that more comprehensive training across various object classes was needed.
