### Text information retrieval application  

Information retrieval is crucial as it can provide rapid access to vast amounts of data, facilitating the discovery of new knowledge. This study investigates the performance of three information retrieval models 1. Vector Space Model, 2. Best Matching 25, and 3. ELECTRA on the Cranfield collection, a renowned benchmark dataset. The objectives were: 1) Implement an indexing component, 2) Develop a ranking system using the three models, 3) Compare models employing the TREC evaluation format, and 4) Integrate the top-performing model into a user interface. Preprocessing involved tokenisation, text normalisation, stopword removal, and index building. The BM25 algorithm emerged as the most effective, with a Mean Average Precision of 0.3137, Precision at 5 of 0.3289, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5 of 0.5170. The work correlated with previous research and found that hyperparameter tuning of BM25 yielded improved results. The BM25 retrieval model was successfully integrated into a Streamlit user interface to demonstrate the undertaken work.
